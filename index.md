We are based in the West Bay water sports centre with a fleet of kayaks, canoes, and sea boats for everyone to use.

We provide all all equipment, you don't need to be particularly fit to start with and everyone over 12yrs old is welcome.

The club meets every Tuesday at 6pm (aiming to be on the water by 6:30) in West Bay.

A session costs £5 to members, £10 to non-members, and membership is £45 per year.

Usually we paddle on the river and sea learning new skills and having fun. We follow the British Canoeing sylabus, for for short journeys, and play some games.

Sessions last a couple of hours and are usualy quite relaxed (and sometimes a bit more energetic) catering for the skill level of those present.

If you want to try out the sport come along

Bring clothes you don't mind getting wet, a wetsuit and wetsuit boots are ideal if you have them. Otherwise something comfortable like a tracksuit - trainers may be OK but tall people with big feet wearing trainers may have problems getting into the boat!

Bring a towel and spare clothes for afterwards - sometimes capsizes happen by accident - and sometimes we practise them.

Be aware that there are risks to kayaking including
