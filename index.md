We are based in the West Bay water sports centre with a fleet of kayaks, canoes, and sea boats for everyone to use.

If you want to try out the sport come along - just bring clothes you don't mind getting wet, a towel and spare clothes for afterwards

We provide all all equipment, you don't need to be particularly fit to start with (you do need to be able to swim 50 meters) and everyone over 12yrs old is welcome.

The club meets every Tuesday at 6pm in West Bay.

A session costs £15 and membership is £40 per year if after a couple of sessions you decide to keep coming.

Usually we paddle on the river learning new skills and having fun. We follow the [BCU sylabus](https://www.britishcanoeing.org.uk/courses/1-star-award), paddle the river, and play some games.

Sessions last a couple of hours and are usualy quite relaxed (and sometimes a bit more energetic) catering for the skill level of those present.

Our first river session of 2018 will be on the 10th of April
