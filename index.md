We are based in the West Bay water sports centre with a fleet of kayaks, canoes, and sea boats for everyone to use.

We provide all all equipment, you don't need to be particularly fit to start with and everyone over 12yrs old is welcome.

The club meets every Tuesday at 6pm (aiming to be on the water by 6:30) in West Bay.

A session costs £5 to members, £10 to non-members, and membership is £45 per year. see [Membersip and Session Fees](./policies/fees) for more details

Usually we paddle on the river learning new skills and having fun. We follow the [BCU sylabus](https://www.britishcanoeing.org.uk/go-canoeing/things-to-do/build-my-skills#star-awards), paddle the river, and play some games.

Sessions last a couple of hours and are usualy quite relaxed (and sometimes a bit more energetic) catering for the skill level of those present.

If you want to try out the sport come along

Bring clothes you don't mind getting wet, a wetsuit and wetsuit boots are ideal if you have them. Otherwise something comfortable like a tracksuit - trainers may be OK but tall people with big feet wearing trainers may have problems getting into the boat!

Bring a towel and spare clothes for afterwards - sometimes capsizes happen by accident - and sometimes we practice them.

Be aware that there are risks to kayaking including

Contact us via phone on 01308 862055 or using our [Contact Form](/contact) to let us know if you want to come along - especially if you are not a confident swimmer (less than 50 meters) or are unsure if kayaking is for you and we'll try to help.
