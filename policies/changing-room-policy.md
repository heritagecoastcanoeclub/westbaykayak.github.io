## DRAFT : Document pending Committee review ##

See also [British Canoing Guidance](https://www.britishcanoeing.org.uk/uploads/documents/G28-Changing-Room-Guidance-270716.pdf)

The Club has no dedicated changing facilkity, members usually change in the boatsheds.

There are two rooms and at times it may be approproate to dicide these on gender lines for a time - but this is limited by the need to put boats away.

There is also a locable toilet that may be used for changing if privacy is needed (especially for those under 18).

Mobiles may not be used in the boatsheds while people are changing.

Members must excercise discretion and sensitity while using these facilities.

If you are uncomfortable, or have seen any innapropriate behaviour please report this to the Welfare Officer (Paula) or anyone on the comittee.
