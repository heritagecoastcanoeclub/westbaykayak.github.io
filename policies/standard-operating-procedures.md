## Use of Club Premises / Equipment ##


The boathouse is normally locked apart fro pm regular Tuesday evening sessions in the summer when it is open at the start and end of each session. When everyone is on the water the boathouse will be locked.

Personal equipment may be stored at the boathouse if agreed by the committee, the club can take no responsibility for such equipment, does not cover it in insurance, and cannot guarantee it wont get used by other members. Access to this will be at normal sessions or by arrangement with a keyholder.
