Sea kayaking takes paddlers further from shore than most could swim in water that is cold. 

All sea paddlers must be assessed by the club for fitness - this must include

 * deep water re-entry where the paddler does not require excessive assistance.
 * ability to maintain a pace of 2 knots for 10 minutes
 * test of low brace - off balance recovery

Conditions to be assessed on teh day and should be withing the abilities of the group as well as within the remit for Sea Kayak Leader.

NB Currently the club does not have a qualified leader and paddlers should be made aware of this.
