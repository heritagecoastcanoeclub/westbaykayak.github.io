# Risk Assessment : West Bay Sea Kayaking #


West Bay Launching on the beach and paddling in any direction for the duration of a normal 2 hour session.

Helmets would be required if there is a significant onshore swell though in these conditions the group would need to be experienced anyway.

Mobile Phone Reception : Good

Leader to carry 
  * VHF
  * Mobile phone 
  * towline
  * First aid kit
  * Keys to boatshed
  * spare paddle
  * emergency hatch repair
  * Compass


Sea kayaking takes paddlers further from shore than most could swim in water that is cold. 

All sea paddlers must be assessed by the club for fitness - this must include

 * deep water re-entry where the paddler does not require excessive assistance.
 * ability to maintain a pace of 2 knots for 10 minutes
 * test of low brace - off balance recovery

Conditions to be assessed on the day and should be withing the abilities of the group as well as within the remit for Sea Kayak Leader.

NB Currently the club does not have a qualified leader and paddlers should be made aware of this.
