# Risk Assessments #

## DRAFT : Document pending Committee review ##

All Club sessions and outings must have a risk assessment completed and approved by the committee

Risk assessment is concerned with the identification of significant hazards which exist, and the reasonable precautions (CONTROLS) that are subsequently put in place, in an effort to minimise risk to participants, clients, staff and the public. 

see [BC Safety Guidance](https://www.britishcanoeing.org.uk/uploads/commonUploads/British-Canoeing-Safety-Guidance.pdf)  pages 18-21 for more guidance on risk assessments



## What constitutes a paddlesport risk? ##


It is important to be realistic about risk assessment in  paddlesport activity; therefore it is sensible to identify only the significant hazard(s) which are present in the actual activity, and the chances of these being harmful (i.e. a risk.) 

When undertaking a risk assessment; look only for hazards which you could reasonably expect to result in significant harm under the conditions and circumstances of your workplace (i.e. activity site.) 

## Expectations of activity ##

It should be expected by those taking part in any paddlesport activity that such things as blisters, fatigue, bumps and bruises, for example, are ‘normal’ occurrences and do not constitute a risk within the context of risk assessment. This point should be highlighted during the pre-­activity briefing, so that clients are aware of this.

Consequently, these factors would not form part of a written risk assessment. 



## Do I need a risk assessment every time I go out ? ## 

A risk assessment should be undertaken and kept for each activity operated in each specific site, but there  should be no need to produce a new one for each time you visit each site or take part in the same activity at the same venue.

While that is not to say that there will not  be variables to consider on each separate occasion, this should be precisely where the leader uses a combination of approaches to monitor and maintain safety, e.g. an  established generic risk assessment identifying the  significant hazards which exist and allowing the pre-­planning of reasonable controls, supported by an ongoing  'dynamic' appraisal of the group, environment and  weather.

This would include the risks generic to the type of  paddlesport undertaken in relation to the site specific  risks to be encountered. Thus adequate control measures  I further control action if necessary, can be identified to  reduce the risk to acceptable levels.
