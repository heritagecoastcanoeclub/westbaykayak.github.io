# Risk Assessment : River Brit  #


The section of the river closest to the boathouse where egress is easy as far as the first bend is "very Sheltered water" and is the area most suitable for complete beginners.

Beyond the first bend there are sections whjere egress is impossible/difficult and this part of the river will need a group with competent deep water rescue ability.
